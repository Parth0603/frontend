## Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Host Flow
1. Navigate to Gaming Zone
2. Click "Create Gaming Room"
3. Allow camera/microphone permissions
4. Click "Start Gaming Session"
5. Copy the room ID (GAME-XXXXXX)
6. Test video/audio controls
7. Test screen sharing
8. Send chat messages

### 3. Test User Flow
1. Open new browser tab/window
2. Navigate to Gaming Zone
3. Click "Join Gaming Room"
4. Enter your name and room ID
5. Allow camera/microphone permissions
6. Click "Join Room"
7. Verify video/audio connection
8. Test screen sharing
9. Send chat messages

### 4. Test WebRTC Features
- Video should appear for both host and users
- Audio should work bidirectionally
- Screen sharing should replace video feed
- Chat messages should appear in real-time
- Participants list should update dynamically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera/Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions
2. **WebRTC connection fails**: Ensure both users are on same network or use STUN servers
3. **Screen sharing not working**: Check browser support and permissions
4. **Chat not working**: Verify Socket.IO connection

### Browser Requirements
- Chrome 60+ (recommended)
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

### Network Requirements
- HTTPS for production (WebRTC requirement)
- STUN/TURN servers for cross-network connections
- Firewall ports: 3478 (STUN), 5349 (TURNS)

## Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- GamingZone.jsx - Main component
- Socket.IO client for signaling
- WebRTC APIs for media streams
- CSS styling in gaming.css

### Backend (Node.js)
- Socket.IO server for signaling
- Gaming room management
- WebRTC offer/answer/ICE handling
- Message broadcasting

### WebRTC Flow
1. Host creates room → Server stores room data
2. User joins room → Server facilitates connection
3. WebRTC signaling → Peer connections established
4. Media streams → Direct P2P communication
5. Screen sharing → Track replacement in peer connections
